# Jonathan Cook

**Getting To Know Me, Getting to Learn All About Me**

## Introduction

_I like patterns; taking abstract ideas and bringing them into the world of the
'real' in order to help people get more done and have more fun._

_I have taken on diverse roles and responsibilities throughout my career.  From individual contributor to systems architect._

## What I'm Looking For

I am seeking a front-end focused Principal Software Engineer, Tech Lead, or Staff Engineer position.
For the right company, that will support me in furthering my career, I am happy to take a Senior Developer role while I learn your business.

My ideal company is past the early startup stage, with developed processes, strong leadership, and a clear strategy and long term vision.

I am a big believer in agile methodologies and iterative delivery, offering both the opportunity to fail quickly, the motivation to succeed, and the incentive to constantly strive for quality code.

The ideal culture for me is one where everyone — particularly leadership, product owners, and managers — is heavily invested in the success of the company, the quality of their work, and personal growth.  But also one where work/life balance is emphasized and tight deadlines don't translate into a high pressure, high stress environment or death marches.

I strongly prefer to work remotely, but am able to make myself available for on-site meetings as 
long as they are near my home in the greater Washington, DC area.

Basically, I've been programming since I was a kid. I have the longest and
closest relationship with the Javascript programming language. Based on my mastery of it's C-style syntax and
experience with application development, I quickly picked up programming Java
and C#, and soon became aware of more rigorous ways to go about solving problems
than are typically associated with Javascript.

At the same time as I like to be conscious of design patterns and algorithms, my
roots as something of a 'cowboy coder' mean that I can get things done and think
outside the proverbial box.

While I'm versed in many of the latest frameworks and libraries like React,
React-Redux, and Redux-Sagas, I don't use the latest and greatest just
because it's cool. That's not me. I evolve existing legacy systems into the future, and
I want to use the right tool for the job. Sometimes that means building out your own tooling,
embracing functional programming, meta-programming, and more.

### Demo Projects

[deck-of-cards](https://go.jonathancook.site/deck-of-cards-repo)
  ([demo](https://go.jonathancook.site/deck-of-cards-demo))

An ES6 implementation of a deck of playing cards, including mix-ins, base
classes, and more.  In addition to implementing a standard deck of playing
cards, the code is extensible and can be used as the basis of any kind of card
deck.

As this is base code which doesn't include any implementation using the classes
the demo site shows information for various project metrics such as code
coverage and complete report of test results.  The test results reporting is
done using React components.

[React Deck-of-Cards](https://go.jonathancook.site/react-deck-of-cards-repo)
  ([demo](https://go.jonathancook.site/react-deck-of-cards-demo))

A React UI using CSS3 Flexbox, showing an implementation of shuffling and
dealing using the
[deck-of-cards](https://go.jonathancook.site/deck-of-cards-repo) code.  Also
allows for changing the card face design between the English pattern and a
Russian "Atlas" design.

[React ACID Trail](https://go.jonathancook.site/react-acid-trail-repo)
  ([demo](https://go.jonathancook.site/react-acid-trail-demo))
  
An ACID Trail is a sequence of colors and/or color names which is generated from
arbitrary data and can serve as a unique identifier for that data, and especially
a particular version of that data.  Distinguishing between different versions of
resources (e.g. files, records) which have the same "base" identifier is a difficult
problem.  I attempt to address this problem by using colors which are not randomly
generated but rather generated as a representation of the data to create.  Identical
versions of the same resource would have the same ACID Trail identifier.

This implementation utilizes ES6 and WebWorkers for the logic and code structure,
and React/Redux and Bootstrap for UI.

A (much) earlier version without ES6, WebWorkers, React, etc. is also linked below.

#### Plugin / Toy

[tower-egg](https://go.jonathancook.site/tower-egg-repo)
  ([demo](https://go.jonathancook.site/tower-egg-demo))

A small javascript puzzle game which implements the 'tower of hanoi' also known
as 'lucas tower'. Designed so it can be embedded easily as an application easter
egg :)
