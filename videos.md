Patients can record daily activities and status in one or many journals and
track and share their progress with providers.  Trends can be viewed in "results"
view for each journal, visible after every entry.  More than one entry may be
made for each day. [[Larger Version](/assets/video/ViiMed - Patient Journals.mp4)]
